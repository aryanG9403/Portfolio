## üìù About The Project

This portfolio is a single-page application designed to be a central hub for my professional work. I created it to demonstrate my ability to build a modern, responsive, and interactive website using fundamental web technologies. The project features a clean design, smooth animations, and is fully deployed on Netlify.

* Manipulating the DOM with JavaScript to create dynamic content.
* Implementing modern CSS features like `z-index`, `position: fixed`, and `transform` for complex UI challenges.
* The full developer workflow: from local development to version control with Git and deploying a live site with Netlify.
